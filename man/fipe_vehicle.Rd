\details{
The Fipe Database shows average prices of vehicles on the national
  market, functioning only as a parameter for negotiations and evaluations.
  The prices effectively used in negotiations vary according to region,
  vehicle's conservation, color, accessories or any other factor that might
  influence the conditions of demand and supply for a specific vehicle.
  The year of the vehicle refers to the year of the model and are not
  considered vehicles for professional or special use. The values are
  expressed in R$ (reais) of the month/year of reference.
